# Surface Overlay
An ebuild repository for packages related to Microsoft Surface devices.
Most ebuilds here are based on the great work at 
[linux-surface](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface).
This overlay is still a WIP, so more packages will be added over time.

## Installing
You can add this overlay via
[eselect repository](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Eselect/Repository) or
[layman](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman).
